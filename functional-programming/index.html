    <h1>Function Programming</h1>
    <p>
      Functional programming is a programming paradigm that treats computation as
      the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and
      mutable data. It's a declarative type of programming style, which means that
      the code describes what it wants to do, rather than how it wants to do it.
      This is in contrast to imperative programming, which is more concerned with
      how to do things.

      In functional programming, functions are first-class citizens, which means
      they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from
      other functions. This allows for more flexibility and modularity in your
      code. Functional programming also encourages the use of higher-order
      functions, which are functions that can take other functions as arguments or
      return them.

      Some of the core concepts of functional programming include pure functions,
      immutability, and referential transparency. Pure functions are functions
      that always return the same output for the same input and have no
      side-effects. Immutability means that once a value is created, it cannot be
      changed. Referential transparency means that a function call can be replaced
      with its return value without changing the program's behavior.

      Functional programming has many benefits, including improved code
      maintainability, testability, and readability. It also makes it easier to
      reason about your code and can help prevent bugs and errors. While it may
      take some time to get used to the functional programming style, it can be a
      powerful tool in your programming arsenal.
