    <h1>Closure</h1>
    <p>
      Imagine your friend gives you a backpack with some snacks. You can carry
      this backpack around, and whenever you're hungry, you just reach in and
      grab a snack. But here's the magic: even if your friend isn't around
      anymore, the snacks in the backpack are still there for you to enjoy! In
      JavaScript, a closure is like that backpack. It's when a function
      remembers and can access the variables from the place where it was
      created, even if that place (like your friend) is gone. So, even when the
      outer function has finished running, the inner function can still use the
      variables from that outer function. It's like having a secret stash of
      snacks that never goes away!
